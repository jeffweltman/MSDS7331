    "We will be examining data about educational outcomes in the state of North Carolina. We decided to work with education data because educational outcomes are a very strong leading predictor for economic growth. This relationship has been borne out through extensive amounts of research by academic institutions and government bodies alike. In a study published by the World Bank in 2007, “The Role of Education Quality in Economic Growth,” Eric A. Hanushek and Ludger Wößmann found that for each additional year of education a country's citizens receive, there is a 0.58% increase in long-term GDP growth. Below we can see a clear positive relationship between years of education and economic growth.\n",

    "\n",
    "While the number of years of education is a helpful barometer, many developed countries have roughly the same amount of compulsory education. Hanushek and Wößmann found that standardized test scores were an even better predictor of economic prosperity. In fct, they found the pattern to be persistent across low- and high-income countries.\n",

    "The particular dataset we will be using is from [The Belk Endowment Educational Attainment Data Repository for North Carolina Public Schools freely available on Github.com](https://github.com/jakemdrew/EducationDataNC). This data repository contains a very large amount of information on public elementary, middle, and high schools from North Carolina, United States. The speicific dataset from this repository we will be primarily working with is the 2017 public high schools \"Machine Learning Dataset\" as available [here](https://github.com/jakemdrew/EducationDataNC/blob/master/2017/Machine%20Learning%20Datasets/PublicHighSchools2017_ML.csv). This dataset contains hundreds of datapoints about hundreds of public high schools across North Carolina. We will fully examine all variables in a later section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supported by Hanushek and Wößmann's findings that standardized test scores are a powerful indicator of economic prosperity, we will seek to understand the relationship between the (many) variables in the Belk dataset and SAT scores. We will bucket all schools into Low/Medium/High performing based on their average SAT score, then look to be able to predict how a school will perform, but perhaps more importantly, understand the factors that cause a school to perform well. This would allow government and non-profit agencies alike to have areas of focus when looking to provide resources to a school.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will seek to measure the quality and usefulness of our analyses from two perspectives. First, we will track the accuracy of our classifier, that is, what percent of schools we correctly classify as Low/Medium/High performing. This will serve to validate that the relationships identified in the data are reliable. Second, we will seek a parsimonious model over a pure black-box because the ultimate value of this analysis is understanding what factors lead to higher performing schools, and redirecting capital to support those schools in need. An algorithm with 100% predictive accuracy but 0% interpretability simply identifies a school as likely to perform poorly on the SAT, which doesn't actually help the students at that school."

SPG Score contains thirteen attributes describing the key performance metric for North Carolina schools.  Of these thirteen only the SPG Score itself is continuous.  Other variables are one-hot encoded variables to describe scoring outcomes.\n",

    "### Data Quality\n",
    "This data set had already undergone preprocessing. As a result, the integrity and quality was already at a high level. Columns were removed during preprocessing if >= 60% of the rows contained null values. Furthermore, nulls were imputed as 0 across all remaining columns. As will be seen below, we confirmed that no null values were present in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Public Schools of North Carolina State Board of Education](http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/accountability/reporting/2017/documentation/datarlstchnts17.pdf) notes that schools with fewer than 10 student SAT scores had their data masked. This means that rows where (*num_sat_average_score* == 0) are not indicative of an actual zero score, but instead represent missing/non-reported data. We removed 49 school records (rows) that met that criteria in order to narrow our dataset to those rows which contained average SAT scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the removal of these non-reporting schools, we were able to identify ten attributes as candidates for removal. The dataset preprocessing generated many attributes through one-hot encoding, and ten of those attributes were only populated by one or more of the schools which did not report SAT average scores. This identification consisted of confirming that the rows contained only zeros across all remaining rows, evidence of imputed nulls and/or non-applicable classification. Therefore, we removed: *ACTWorkKeys_SilverPlus_LEP*, *grade_range_cd_3-12*, *grade_range_cd_7-13*, *grade_range_cd_9-11*, *grade_range_cd_9-9*, *Reading SPG Grade_F*, *grades_BYOD_9*, *grades_BYOD_9:10:11*, *SRC_Grades_Devices_Sent_Home_6:7:8:9:10:11:12:13*, and *SRC_Grades_Devices_Sent_Home_9:10:12*."
