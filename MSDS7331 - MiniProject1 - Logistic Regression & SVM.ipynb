Assess how well each model performs (use 80/20 training/testing split for your data). Adjust parameters of the models to make them more accurate. If your dataset size requires the use of stochastic gradient descent, then linear kernel only is fine to use. That is, the SGDClassifier is fine to use for optimizing logistic regression and linear support vector machines. For many problems, SGD will be required in order to train the SVM model in a reasonable timeframe**\n",
